bartending app that allows users to select and add cocktail recipes using spirits and mixers 


In order to test or run app, use run.rb in tools folder. This will drop the table every time it is run, so make sure to delete seed file from run.rb if you wish to keep a ongoing database. 

Currently we only have mixers and spirits as primary ingredients, but we hope to update with liqueurs, produce, bitters, and syrups.  

Cheers!
